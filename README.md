# Â» Lorem Ipsum Site 
### Educational project. [ `HTML5` | `CSS` ]

<br>
I created this site using HTML and CSS during the first two weeks of study.<br>
The site adapts to any device thanks to the use of flexboxes and media queries.<br>
The images were taken from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/it-it/) with a free licence.<br>

> There are mistakes I could have corrected, but I chose not to on purpose.<br>
> In this way I intend to keep a history of my progress.<br>
